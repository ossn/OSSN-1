                Budget and swag are not yet available through the Open Source
                Student Network program. However we recommend checking your
                University&#39;s website or student union to find out about
                whether funding is available through your school.

              >
                You do not have to have “Mozilla” in your club name to
                participate. In fact, we encourage you to keep your name focused
                on the purpose of your club. However we do require that clubs
                registered with the open source student network have a focus on
                learning about, contributing to, or creating open source
                projects.

              >
                Yes, multiple technical clubs from the same campus can register
                with Mozilla. For example, on one campus the Women in Computing
                Club, and an Open Source CS Club, may both be part of the
                network.

                id="faq-2-item-6"
              >
                No. Part of the definition of a club is that they meet regularly
                in person, while some activities will definitely be virtual, in
                order to be recognized as a part of the network they need to be
                primarily based on a real life campus.

                If you are passionate about open source and are interested in
                finding more ways to contribute we encourage you to use all of
                the resources freely available on the site to get started
                contributing locally. However only Clubs or Societies based on a
                University or Post-Secondary campus will be officially
                recognized by the program.
